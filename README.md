# Build Simple Music Player Appliaction

In developing a simple music player application using Flutter, I utilize the Audioplayers package to provide reliable music playback features. Integrating provider as state management allows us to efficiently manage the music playback status, enabling users to enjoy a seamless listening experience. Thus, I present a simple music player that is easy to develop further.
